              <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
                  <p>I am a Harm Reduction Educator and Advocate. In 2019, I created a non-profit harm reduction organization called “Safe Raving”.</p>
                  <p>Payton Govas,Jessica Good and myself, provide non-judgmental, pragmatic, and compassionate support to our community and the clients we serve together.</p>
                  <p>We provide harm reduction support and services to clients at raves and festivals.
                      An example of our services includes how we teach people about <abbr title="Overdose Recognition, Response, and Prevention">ORRP</abbr>. This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> year Safe Raving has been active. </p>

                  <h3>More About Me</h3>
                      <p>When I am not working my role in Harm Reduction services, I am likely <em>cathartically</em> expressing my creativity through my art. I love working with different mediums. </p><p> For example, I love painting, drawing, dying my own hair, sewing, shooting photoshoots, making digital art and stickers.</p>
                      My art is very <span class="colourful"><em>psychedlic.</em></span>
                      <p> Just like my tattoos and hair.</p>
