        <article>
            <p>I am a Harm Reduction Educator and Advocate. In 2019, I created a non-profit harm reduction organization called “Safe Raving”. 
                <div><div>Payton Govas,Jessica Good and myself, provide non-judgmental, pragmatic, and compassionate support to our community and the clients we serve together.</div> 
            <div>We provide harm reduction support and services to clients at raves and festivals.</div>
                <div>An example of our services includes how we teach people about <abbr title="Overdose Recognition, Response, and Prevention">ORRP</abbr>.</div> 
                <div>This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> year Safe Raving has been active. </div> </p>

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p>When I am not working my role in Harm Reduction services, I am likely <em>cathartically</em> expressing my creativity through my art. <div>I love working with different mediums.</div> <div> For example, I love painting, drawing, dying my own hair, sewing, shooting photoshoots, making digital art and stickers.</div><div> My art is very <strong>colourful</strong>, just like my tattoos and hair.</div></p>
